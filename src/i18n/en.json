        "1": "GraphiQL is a playground/IDE for graphQL requests.",
        "2": "GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries using a type system you define for your data. GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data.",
        "3": "GraphQL queries always return predictable results. Apps using GraphQL are fast and stable because they control the data they get, not the server",
        "4": "GraphQL queries access not just the properties of one resource but also smoothly follow references between them. While typical REST APIs require loading from multiple URLs, GraphQL APIs get all the data your app needs in a single request. Apps using GraphQL can be quick even on slow mobile network connections",
        "5": "GraphQL APIs are organized in terms of types and fields, not endpoints. Access the full capabilities of your data from a single endpoint. GraphQL uses types to ensure Apps only ask for whatâ€™s possible and provide clear and helpful errors. Apps can use types to avoid writing manual parsing code."
